<h1>Issues corrected in Keyman 6.0.153.0</h1>

<ol>
 <li>Fixed - Fixed problems with Keyman stopping responding to keyboard input. 
          (reported by Roland Fumey)

 <li>Fixed - Fixed problems with shift state being incorrectly managed when 
          switching between applications.

 <li>Fixed - Disabled interaction with console windows (Console window sets focus 
          to NULL so Keyman keyboard hook will be inactive if no window is 
          focused).

 <li>Fixed - Fixed problems with Capslock and Numlock state being incorrectly 
          identified when switching applications.

 <li>Fixed - Creation of links for uninstall of packages and packages with spaces
          in filename was incorrect -- need quotes around package name.

 <li>Fixed - Install of Start Menu items in packages was missing the pathname in 
          some situations.

 <li>Fixed - Misleading error message when Keyman registry settings missing 
          ("not Administrator" instead of "Keyman not installed correctly")

 <li>Fixed - Keyman 6 startup now shows version number.

 <li>Fixed - Space bar now activates check boxes and buttons when Keyman keyboard is active,
          but only if space bar is not remapped.
</ol>


<h1>Issues corrected in Keyman 6.0.152.0</h1>

<ol>
 <li>Fixed - When installing a redistributable installer with packages, the sub-packages create 
          Start Menu items with incorrect targets: the targets point to temp directory instead 
          of install directory.  Also, Start menu items requested other than Keyman, Kmshell, 
          and the identified readme file were created but with empty targets (i.e. they were 
          non-functional).

 <li>Fixed - Windows key does not work when keyboard is active on some systems.

 <li>Fixed - Crash in Projects window when opening/closing tree branches.

 <li>Fixed - After having opened and compiled a keyboard, Package for Distribution resulted 
          in the new window going into background rather than foreground.

 <li>Fixed - In the debugger, deadkeys stopped working after a few lines of input.

 <li>New   - Keyman compiler in TIKE will now halt if ESC is pressed.
          KMComp will halt on Ctrl+Break.

 <li>Fixed - With ANSI character set, the Character map doesn't do any 
          automatic look-ups on the last line of the character map grid.

 <li>New   - Stop button in Debug window

 <li>Fixed - When numlock is on, keyboards do not work correctly.  Caps lock rules are not implemented 
          correctly either; the fixes for this in Keyman 5.0.113.3 have also been applied to KM6.

 <li>Fixed - Keyman Uninstall did not uninstall lpng.dll

 <li>Mod.  - Uninstall will now wait 10 seconds before timeout message if kmshell does not exit.

 <li>Fixed - Keyman uninstall did not prompt for reboot when reboot was required.

 <li>Fixed - Added version information to richedit.kma

 <li>Fixed - Added version information to version_upgrade.dll

 <li>Fixed - HOWTO items in PDF help now displayed correctly

 <li>Fixed - Dev help: added "lpng.dll", "keyman.exe" to redistributable installer information

 <li>Fixed - Dev help: deadkeys and virtual keys within stores now documented

 <li>Fixed - Dev help: context(n) history now documented

 <li>Fixed - Keyman help can't find KMSHELL.EXE; Start Menu link needed to have working directory set

 <li>Fixed - Addins only install when they are required; e.g. if Word not installed, WordLink won't install

 <li>Fixed - "Keyman 5.0" title bar in startup of redistributable installer
</ol>
