SECTION:      Configuration - Add-ins tab

HEADING:      Add-ins tab

TEXT:         This tab lists all the installed add-ins for Keyman.  An add-in adds input functionality to a 
              particular software program, or a group of software programs.  An add-in can add support for 
              Unicode input in Windows 95/98/Me, or more complex interactions, such as the Text Services Framework
              add-in.

TEXT:         Keyman add-ins can have a .kma extension, or can be included in a package, in which case they have a .kmp
              extension.

TEXT:         An add-in can be installed for all users, or only the current user.  Some add-ins require administrative
              privileges to install, whereas others must be installed for each user.
