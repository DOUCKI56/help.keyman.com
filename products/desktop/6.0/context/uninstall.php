SECTION:      Uninstall Dialog
TEXT:         This dialog appears when you uninstall a keyboard, package, or Keyman itself.  When uninstalling, you have the option of
              leaving fonts that were installed on your system, so that you can continue to read documents that you created using the
              fonts.  To do this, check the box "Don't uninstall fonts".
