VERSION INFORMATION
===================

TAVULTESOFT KEYBOARD MANAGER 4.01
=================================

13 June 1999

New Features in Tavultesoft Keyboard Manager 4.0
------------------------------------------------

Keyman 4.0 has been totally rewritten from the ground up to support Windows 95, 98 and NT 4.  
This means that this version of Keyman will not run under Windows 3.1 or Windows for 
Workgroups.  There are a number of new features:

* Integration with the Windows 95/NT language interface.  This means that you will 
  select your languages from the task bar, as in standard Windows 95.  It also means 
  that your word processor will be able to automatically switch languages when you 
  select a Keyman keyboard.
* Separation of the keyboard language from the main Keyman program.  This means you 
  don't have the overhead of an interpreter/compiler in the Keyman program, but rather 
  compile the keyboards in a separate program.
* Shareware registration.  Keyman 4.0 is not a freeware product, but is now shareware.  
  The cost is US$30/license.  See LICENSE.TXT for more details.


Bugs fixed in version 4.01
--------------------------

* Virtual key codes were not accepted for input.
* Numeric keypad characters werer incorrectly translated when numlock on.
* Using a capital 'C' for a comment caused the compiler to hang.
* Custom language ids were unreliable in some circumstances.
* Sublanguage ids above x20 didn't work.
* Uninstall functionality now removes keyboards correctly, and can remove Windows keyboards as well as Keyman ones.
* Uninstall does not use a secondary, unnecessary dialog now.
* Language selection menu works correctly if cancelled.
* Install keyboard works correctly if existing keyboards were previously installed in the same language.
* Language selection menu works shows all items correctly under Windows NT.
* The language icon shows the correct icon more accurately now.


Other changes in version 4.01
-----------------------------

* The keyman compiler (KMCOMP) will now work under the evaluation license.
