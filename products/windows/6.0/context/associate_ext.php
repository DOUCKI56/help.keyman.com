SECTION:      Associations Lost
TEXT:         This message is shown when Keyman discovers that it is no longer the default application for opening .kmx
              and .kmp files. If this is a problem, you can choose Yes to restore the correct association for these files.

HEADING:      Don't ask me this anymore
TEXT:         If you wish the default application for these files to be something other than Keyman, you can tell
              Keyman not to ask this question again.
