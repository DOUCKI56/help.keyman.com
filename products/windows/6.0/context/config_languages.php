BODY

SECTION:      Configuration - Languages tab

HEADING:      Languages tab

TEXT:         This tab lists all the installed languages in the system, and the keyboard associated with each one.  In
              Keyman 6, you can choose a Keyman keyboard that should be switched on whenever a given language is selected.

TEXT:         To select a keyboard for a language, click the entry in the "Keyman Keyboard" column or press F2, spacebar or
              enter to change it.  After making your selection, click OK to save changes.

TEXT:         You can click the "Control Panel/Languages" button to open the Control Panel applet which controls the 
              list of installed languages.

TEXT:         You can also choose the underlying layout which you'd like to use for Keyman keyboards.  For many keyboards,
              the underlying layout is not relevant, but for phonetic and related keyboards, the underlying layout can change
              the position of the keys in the Keyman keyboard.
