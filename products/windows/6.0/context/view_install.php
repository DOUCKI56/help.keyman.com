PAGE:         Install Keyboard - Install Options Tab

BODY

SECTION:      Install Options tab
TEXT:         

HEADING:      Install for Immediate Use
TEXT:         If checked, the keyboard will be enabled after installation, and will be accessible from the keyboard menu.
              If unchecked, the keyboard must be enabled in Keyman Configuration before it can be used.

HEADING:      Hotkey
TEXT:         Allows you to choose a hotkey with which to activate the keyboard. This makes it faster to switch between
              keyboards without using the mouse. You should be careful to choose a hotkey that will not conflict with any
              hotkeys in the applications that you use, because the keyboard hotkey will prevent them from working in such
              a case.
