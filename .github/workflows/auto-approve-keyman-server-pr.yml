# Automatically approves pull requests opened by keyman-server
# The initial use of this action is to upload product help documentation
# with resources/build/help-keyman-com.sh.
# That script creates a PR and then this workflow will be
# triggered to approve the PR, and then auto-merge-keyman-server-pr.yml
# will merge it
