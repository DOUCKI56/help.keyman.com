<h2>Set lexical model project output path</h2>

<p>
    The Keyman lexical models repository is organized so that each lexical model builds into its own <strong>build\</strong> folder.
    With your lexical model project open in Keyman Developer, set the project output path through the menu:
</p>

<p>
    Project --> Project Settings...
</p>

<p>
    <img src="<?php echo cdn("img/developer/keyboards/project-settings.png"); ?>" />
</p>
