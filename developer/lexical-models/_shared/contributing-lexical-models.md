title:  Contributing lexical models
---
  
We do have a baseline for accepting contributed lexical models. While we
can work with you on getting your lexical model ready, you can ease the
process dramatically by following the guidelines weâ€™ve already written.

These design patterns and requirements assume some knowledge of Keyman
Developer and Keyman lexical model development. Keyman Developer is
downloadable from
[https://keyman.com/developer](https://keyman.com/developer),
and the documentation is online at
[https://help.keyman.com/developer/current-version/guides/lexical-models/tutorial](../../current-version/guides/lexical-models/tutorial).
