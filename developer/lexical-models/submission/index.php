<h1>Guide for Lexical Model Submissions</h1>
<p>
  This is a guide for submitting lexical models to the lexical-models repository.
  Lexical model developers will need to be proficient enough with Git to keep their own fork in sync with the upstream branch.
  Though this can be daunting, there are many other online resources for new users to Git.
</p>

<p class="hint">
  <b>Note:</b> This guide is written for lexical model developers using Windows, so other OS users need to adjust paths accordingly.
