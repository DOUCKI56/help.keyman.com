If you selected any plan other than a free subscription, you will need to arrange a method of payment.  While making automatic monthly payments by credit card is the most straightforward way to pay for your subscription, it is also possible to pay for 3 months or 12 months in advance, with various options for payment method.  These payments are processed through the Tavultesoft Online Store.  Paying for 12 months in advance attracts a 15% discount.</p>

<p>When entering your details to arrange payment for your KeymanWeb subscription, please check carefully that they are all correct, as any delays caused by mistakes will result in your subscription also being delayed.</p>
