KeymanWeb is designed to work with a wide range of popular browsers.  We recommend you install the most recent version of your browser as this will ensure you have the most up-to-date language support.</p>
<p>In order for KeymanWeb to function correctly, JavaScript must be enabled.</p>
<p>KeymanWeb works most efficiently on browsers which support embedded fonts.  If you are using an older browser, it may be necessary to install fonts for your desired language (or update your browser software) to access the features of KeymanWeb.</p>

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Firefox 2, 3, 3.5</i>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Safari 4</i>
