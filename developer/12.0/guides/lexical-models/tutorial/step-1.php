<h1>Step 1: Prerequisites for building a lexical model</h1>

<p> To prepare a lexical model based on a word list, we will need a few things: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Install <a href="https://keyman.com/developer">Keyman Developer</a> 12.0 or greater (Windows only)</li>
  <li> A list of words in your langauge, stored in an spreadsheet, in dictionary-making software or, other means. </li>
</ul>

<p> Once we have the prerequisite software and data, we can begin to prepare the data! </p>
