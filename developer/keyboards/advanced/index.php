<h1>Advanced Guide for Keyboard Submissions</h1>
<p>
    This is an advanced guide for keyboard maintainers who will be submitting pull requests to the full keyboards repository.
    Users will need to be proficient enough with Git to keep their own fork in sync with the upstream branch.
    If that sounds intimidating, maybe consider using the Starter guide instead.

    <b>Note:</b> This guide is written for Windows users, so other OS users need to adjust paths accordingly.
