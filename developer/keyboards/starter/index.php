<h1>Starting Guide for Submitting a Single Keyboard</h1>

<p>
    This Starting guide is intended for keyboard developers who are submitting only one or two keyboards.
    If you are a relatively new Git user, this is the guide for you. The Advanced guide provides separate instructions
    for deeper involvement in submitting, improving, and reviewing keyboards.
</p>

<p class="hint">
    <b>Note:</b> This guide is written for Windows users, so other OS users need to adjust paths accordingly.
