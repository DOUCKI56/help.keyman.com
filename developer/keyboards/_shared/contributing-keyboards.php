<h2>Contributing keyboards</h2>

<p>
    We do have a baseline for accepting contributed keyboards. While we can work with you on getting your keyboards ready,
    you can ease the process dramatically by following the guidelines weâ€™ve already written.
</p>

<p>
    These design patterns and requirements assume some knowledge of Keyman Developer and Keyman keyboard development.
    Keyman Developer is downloadable from <a href="https://keyman.com/developer" target="_blank">https://keyman.com/developer</a>,
    and the documentation is online at <a href="https://help.keyman.com/developer" target="_blank">https://help.keyman.com/developer</a>.
