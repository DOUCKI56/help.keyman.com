    Products based on Keyman Engine can be licensed in one of three different ways:
  </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
        Freeware: You as a keyboard developer purchase a single license to distribute a specified
        number of keyboards for Keyman Engine globally, at no cost to end users. You are not permitted to
        sell the product and you must list it on the Tavultesoft website keyboard page. Contact
        Tavultesoft sales for pricing as it is dependant on a number of factors.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Global: You can resell your product at any price you wish. You purchase a licence to
        distribute the Keyman Engine and a specified number of keyboards. All copy protection and
        license management is left to you -- the Keyman Engine will not prevent the keyboards from
        running, but you can manage this by providing your own controller program.
      </p></li><li><p>
        Shareware: In this model, you can distribute as many keyboards as you wish. Keyboards are
        copy-protected and will only operate for the time period you specify before requiring
        payment (the evaluation period).  This is the model recommended for most developers, as
        it provides the most support and infrastructure, to minimize the work you need to do to
        create a keyboard solution.
      </p><p>
        You can list your product in the Tavultesoft Online Store, and this will enable instantaneou
        purchase and activation of your product by end users, with Credit Card, Paypal, and other payment
        methods available automatically. [Read more about Online Store listings]
      </p><p>
        You can also pre-purchase licenses of Keyman Engine at a substantial discount to onsell to your
        users. The advantage here is you can pre-install on computers or distribute licenses, selling at
        whatever price you wish. End users are still required to activate their license, with the license
        key you have provided them, ensuring that the licenses cannot be redistributed. [Read more about pre-purchasing licenses]
      </p><p>
        This model also utilises the CRM module of Keyman Developer -- using this module, you can manage
        all your customer records, purchase licenses, allocate pre-purchased seats and check which
        customers have activated their licenses. [Read more about the CRM]
      </p></li></ol></div><p>
    With each of the above models, keyboards will be encrypted to operate only with the branding
    file selected during product development. Usually this linkage will be done in the Distribution
    Editor compile stage, but you can also do it manually if you prefer.
  </p><p>
    Enter the name of the product - this will be displayed on the Tavultesoft website, and in the product installer,
    when you create that later on.  A version number is not necessary here.
  </p><p>
    Select the licensing type that you have decided on, and if you are using the Shareware model, enter the number of
    days that users can try your product before they must purchase a license in the Trial Day Count box.
