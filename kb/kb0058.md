# Keyboard Mapping for Linux (KMFL)

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<h1>Background</h1>

<p>KMFL is a keyboarding input method currently being developed under Linux which aims to bring Keyman Desktop functionality to *nix operating systems. KMFL is being jointly developed by SIL International (<a href='http://www.sil.org/'>www.sil.org</a>) and Tavultesoft (<a href='http://www.tavultesoft.com/'>www.tavultesoft.com</a>). It is being released under the GPL license.</p>

<p>The current implementation of KMFL uses the SCIM platform (<a href='http://www.scim-im.org/'>www.scim-im.org</a>) to handle the input method interface to X. KMFL consists of three parts: a library which provides an engine to interpret compiled KMFL keyboard tables, a keyboard compiler, and an SCIM input method engine. Note that the library and the keyboard compiler are independent from the SCIM input method. This design allows KMFL to use other frameworks such as IIIMF to provide input method services to an operating system at a later date.</p>

<p>KMFL aims to be source compatible with keyboards developed for Keyman Desktop. Binary keyboards compiled for Keyman Desktop will not run under KMFL. Such keyboards will need to be compiled with the supplied KMFL keyboard compiler. KMFL is also Unicode based, and does not support legacy code pages and encodings.</p>
