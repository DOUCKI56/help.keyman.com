# Keyman starts very slowly (especially on Windows Server 2003)

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<h2>Explanation</h2><p>
To ensure that Keyman and Keyman Developer have not become corrupted, an integrity check is executed 
each time either application is started.  Part of this check involves verifying a digital signature, 
or certificate, using the standard Internet certificate validation process. Certain certificate checking 
options require an on-line test of certificate validity with a certificate authority, which requires 
an open internet connection and makes starting take a long time.  This option is enabled by default 
on Windows Server 2003, and may be enabled in some situations with other versions of Windows.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2><p>
Recommended solution: Upgrade to version 6.2.171.0 or later.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This behaviour has changed since 6.2.171.0.  Keyman and Keyman Developer no longer verify
certificate revocation, so this behaviour no longer occurs.</p>
<p>
Alternative solution: Go to <b>Control Panel->Internet Properties->Advanced</b> and disable "Check for  
publisher's certificate revocation" and "Check for server certificate revocation" by clearing the two 
check boxes indicated in the following image.
