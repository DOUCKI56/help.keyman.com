# Windows language switcher does not always select keyboards correctly

<h1>Symptoms</h1>

<p>On some systems, the Windows 8.1 language switcher, accessible by clicking the language code near the clock, or by holding Windows key and pressing Space, does not select a keyboard layout correctly first time. Instead, the default language/keyboard is selected. The second time you select the keyboard, it is correctly selected.</p>

<h1>Workarounds</h1>

<ul>
<li>Use Keyman's keyboard switching, via hotkey or language menu, to choose the language instead.</li>
<li>Or, select the keyboard twice with the Windows language switcher.</li>
</ul>
