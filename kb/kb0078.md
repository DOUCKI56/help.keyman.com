# HOWTO: Use Keyman Desktop with Metro-style applications in Windows 8 Consumer Preview

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>While Keyman Desktop 8.0 runs fine with traditional Windows applications, by default it will not run with Metro-style applications in Windows 8, due to added security restrictions.  These restrictions prevent the Keyman Engine from reading settings and keyboards when switching to a Keyman Desktop keyboard in a Metro-style application.</p>

<h1>Workaround</h1>

<p>In due course Tavultesoft will release an update to Keyman Desktop which resolves this problem completely.  In the meantime, the following steps will allow you to use your Keyman Desktop keyboards within Metro-style applications:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start Registry Editor, and navigate to <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tavultesoft</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>Edit|Permissions...</b>, click <b>Add...</b> and type <b>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</b> and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
<li>Ensure <b>Full Control</b> is ticked, and click <b>OK</b>
<li>Press Windows Key+R and type <b>%AppData%</b> into the Window/Run dialog that appears, and click <b>OK</b></li>
<li>Right-click on <b>Tavultesoft</b> in the folder and select <b>Properties</b>, select the <b>Security</b> tab, and click <b>Edit...</b>.
<li>Click <b>Add...</b>, type <b>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</b> and click <b>OK</b>.  Ensure <b>Read & execute</b> is ticked, and click <b>OK</b>, and <b>OK</b> again.
</ol>

<p>You may need to close and restart all your Metro-style apps and Keyman Desktop itself in order for this procedure to take effect.</p>
