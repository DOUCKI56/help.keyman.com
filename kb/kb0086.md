# Microsoft Word smart quotes interferes with deadkeys and rule matches

<p>Microsoft Word has a feature that automatically converts straight quotation marks ( ' or " ) to curly (smart or typographer's) quotes ( Smart single quotation marks or Smart double quotation marks ) as you type.</p>

<p>However, some Keyman keyboards such as EWTS Tibetan rely on the straight quote as a deadkey or in a rule match, so when it is changed to the smart quote, the deadkey or rule match no longer runs!</p>

<p>You can disable this feature in Microsoft Word by following the instructions here:</p>

<p>To turn this feature on or off:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect Options, and then click the AutoFormat As You Type tab.</li>
<li>2) Under Replace as you type, select or clear the "Straight quotes" with "smart quotes" check box.</li>
</ul>
