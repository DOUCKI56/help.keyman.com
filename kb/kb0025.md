# HOWTO: Identify which Tavultesoft products are installed using the registry

<p>This document is a technical reference for system administrators.  You should normally check the version of Tavultesoft products that you have installed by starting the product and checking its About dialog or Support page.</p>

<p>You can check which Keyman products are installed on your system through the following registry keys.</p>

<table class='display grid'>
<tr><th>Title</th><th>Executable Filename</th><th>Registry Key or Registry Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman 5.0</td><td>keyman.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman\5.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Developer 5.0</td><td>tike.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman Developer\5.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Standard Edition 6.x</td><td>keyman.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman\6.0 [edition] = “Standard”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Home Use Edition 6.x</td><td>keyman.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman\6.0 [edition] = “FreeHomeUse”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Corporate Edition 6.x</td><td>Keyman.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman\6.0 [edition] = “Corporate”</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Developer Standard 6.x or<br/>
Keyman Developer Professional 6.x*</td><td>tike.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman Developer\6.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Developer Professional 7.0</td><td>tike.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman Developer\7.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Desktop Light 7.0</td><td>keyman.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman Engine\7.0\Installed Products\desktop_light</td></tr>
<tr><td>Keyman Desktop Professional 7.0</td><td>keyman.exe</td><td>HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman Engine\7.0\Installed Products\desktop_pro</td></tr>
</table>

<p>* To determine whether you have licensed Keyman Developer Standard 6.x or Keyman Developer Professional 6.x, you will need to check the Help/About dialog after starting “TIKE” as the installed application is identical.</p>
