# HOWTO: Use Keyman in Excel

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<h2>Using Keyman in Excel with the <b>/</b> Key</h2>
<p>Keyboard layouts which rely on the '<b>/</b>' key cause difficulty in Microsoft Excel. In order to provide legacy compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3, by default using the '/' key in Excel activates keyboard shortcuts. There are two solutions to this problem.</p>

<h3>Solution 1</h3>
<p>Press F2 -- Whenever you type text in Excel using a layout which relies on '/', press the F2 key to enter the cell before typing.</p>

<h3>Solution 2</h3>
<p> Disable '/' shortcuts -- In the Microsoft Office Excel menu, disable the use of '/' as a shortcut key.</p>
<p>In Excel 2007:</p> 
 <ol>
  <li>Open the Office menu button in Excel</li>
  <li>Click <b>Excel Options</b></li>
  <li>Select <b>Advanced</b></li>
  <li>Scroll down to <b>Lotus Compatibility</b></li>
  <li>Delete '/' in the text box beside <b>Microsoft Office Excel <u>m</u>enu key:</b></li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b></li>
 </ol>

<h2>Keeping Context in Excel</h2>
<p>The first key typed into any cell in Excel causes Excel to switch input into a new window. The switch of windows between the first and second key typed will cause Keyman to lose context. Any subsequent keys typed will be fine, but youâ€™ll run into difficulty if you depend on the context of the first character. To avoid this problem, you need to press F2 first before typing in any cell.</p>
