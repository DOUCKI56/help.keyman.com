# WORKAROUND: Fonts may be missing from Character Map font dialog in Windows 7

<p>On Windows 7, you may find that some non-Western script fonts are missing from the list of keyboards when you choose a font in Character Map.  This is because Windows, by default, hides fonts that it thinks you don't want to use.</p>

<p>To change this setting, go to Control Panel, type "Font Settings" and click the "Change Font Settings" link, untick "Hide fonts based on language settings" and click OK.</p>
