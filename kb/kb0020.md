<p>Error Starting Program:</p>
<p>‘The MSIMG32.DLL file is linked to missing export GDI32.DLL.GdiGradientFill.’</p>

<p>Applies to: Keyman Desktop 7.0 under Windows 98SE (possibly Windows 95 and ME as well)</p>

<p>The above error message may appear when attempting to start Keyman Desktop under Windows 98SE. It is due to some applications updating MSIMG32.DLL with a version of the DLL distributed with Windows 2000 or later.</p>

<p>The correct version number of the DLL is: 5.00.1693.1.  It can be obtained from the Windows 98SE installation CD using System File Checker.</p>

<p>The INCORRECT version is 5.00.2180.0 -- this version is only distributed with Windows 2000 or later.</p>

## Applies to:
 * Keyman Desktop Corporate 7.0
 * Keyman Desktop Light 7.0
 * Keyman Desktop Professional 7.0
