# You receive a message "Unable to find valid installed product."

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>If you are in an environment where the typical user has a roaming account and uses computers that are frequently rebuilt, you may find that Keyman does not start when you login to the computer.  You may receive an error message stating "Unable to find valid installed product."</p>

<p>In this situation, when you start Keyman Desktop from the Desktop or Start Menu shortcut, you will see a Windows Installer progress dialog appear briefly before Keyman Desktop starts successfully.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>This issue occurs because the registry enter to start Keyman with Windows does not run the Windows Installer automatic configuration, as the shortcuts on the Start Menu and Desktop do.  Windows Installer will automatically configure Keyman Desktop for a user profile when Keyman is first started in those circumstances.</p>

<h2>How to fix this problem</h2>

<p>First, try to repair the product by starting Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs, finding the Tavultesoft Keyman Desktop 7.0 entry and selecting "Change" or "Repair".</p>
