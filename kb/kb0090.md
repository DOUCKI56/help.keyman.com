# BUG: Custom keyboard does not update automatically

<h1>Symptoms</h1>

<p>You have a custom keyboard installed in Keyman for iPhone and iPad, and you install an updated version of the keyboard. However, after installation, the old version of the keyboard still appears.</p>

<p>This is a known issue in Keyman 2.2 and 2.3. It will be addressed in a future update.</p>

<h1>Workaround</h1>

<p>After installing the updated keyboard, double-tap on the Home button, and slide the Keyman app off the app switcher that appears, to close Keyman completely. Once you restart Keyman, the updated keyboard should appear.</p>
