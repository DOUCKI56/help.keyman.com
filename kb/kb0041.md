# HOWTO: Configure Windows for right-to-left languages such as Arabic, Farsi or Hebrew

<p>Languages such as Arabic, Farsi and Hebrew require right-to-left language support. Without right-to-left support, characters in these languages may appear in the wrong order, not join correctly, or change unexpectedly after a spacebar is pressed. Below are instructions for configuring Windows for right-to-left languages.  Note: The procedure is usually unnecessary in Keyman Desktop 7.0.245.0 and later versions.</p>

<p><b>Windows Vista and Windows 7</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Control Panel, "Change keyboards or other input methods", under the "Clock, Language and Region" option (in Classic View, select Regional and Language Options, Keyboards and Languages tab)</li>
<li>Click Change Keyboards, click Add</li>
<li>Select your right-to-left language for the Input language*, and the <b>US</b> keyboard layout from the "Keyboard layout/IME" list. Note: the Windows English (USA, International) keyboard is not identical to the Windows US keyboard. We <b>do not</b> recommend associating to the English (USA, International) keyboard.</li>  
<li>Click OK, OK, OK</li>
<li>Start Keyman Configuration, and click the Languages tab</li>
<li>For your right-to-left language entry, select the Keyman keyboard and click OK</li>
</ol>

<p>* If your language does not appear in the list, use either Hebrew or Arabic instead.</p>

<p><b>Windows XP</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Control Panel, Regional and Language Options, Languages tab</li>
<li>Make sure that "Install files for complex script and right-to-left languages (including Thai)" is ticked: If it isn't ticked, tick it and click OK, follow the prompts to restart Windows, and start this process again.</li>
<li>Click Details button, click Add</li>
<li>Select your right-to-left language for the Input language*, and the <b>US</b> keyboard layout from the "Keyboard layout/IME" list. Note: the Windows English (USA, International) keyboard is not identical to the Windows US keyboard. We <b>do not</b> recommend associating to the English (USA, International) keyboard.</li>  
<li>Click OK, OK, OK</li>
<li>Start Keyman Configuration, and click the Languages tab</li>
<li>For your right-to-left language entry, select the Keyman keyboard and click OK</li>
</ol>

<p>* If your language does not appear in the list, use either Hebrew or Arabic instead.</p>

<p><b>Windows 2000</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Control Panel, Regional Options, General tab</li>
<li>In the "Language settings for the system" box, make sure that your language* is ticked: If it isn't ticked, tick it and click OK, follow the prompts to restart Windows, and start this process again.</li>
<li>Click Input Locales tab, click Add</li>
<li>Select your right-to-left language for the Input language*, and the <b>US</b> keyboard layout from the "Keyboard layout/IME" list. Note: the Windows English (USA, International) keyboard is not identical to the Windows US keyboard. We <b>do not</b> recommend associating to the English (USA, International) keyboard.</li>  
<li>Click OK, OK</li>
<li>Start Keyman Configuration, and click the Languages tab</li>
<li>For your right-to-left language entry, select the Keyman keyboard and click OK</li>
</ol>

<p>* If your language does not appear in the list, use either Hebrew or Arabic instead.</p>

<p><b>Microsoft Office</b></p>

<p>If you are using Microsoft Office, the following additional steps are required:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click Start menu, All Programs, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Office Tools, Microsoft Office  Language Settings</li>
<li>In the list of available languages, select your right to left language and click Add &gt;&gt;.  (Note - unlike elsewhere in Windows, in this list Farsi is listed under Persian)</li>
<li>Click OK to save changes.  You may need to restart your Office applications</li>
</ol>

<p><b>If you are using Keyman 7.0.243.0 or earlier version:</b> You should switch to your right-to-left language by clicking the Windows “EN” language icon and choosing the language from the list – rather than using the Keyman keyboard selector.  This procedure is unnecessary with Keyman 7.0.245 and later versions.</p>
