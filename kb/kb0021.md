# Characters appearing smaller than the selected font size

<p>If you are typing with a font that does not include all character glyphs, some characters may appear at a smaller size than the selected font size.</p>

<p>This is due to Windows font-linking -- it automatically selects a different font for those characters when the current font does not contain glyphs for them them.</p>

<p>To correct this problem, select a font which includes glyphs for all the characters you are using.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE: In Notepad, using the SIL IPA Unicode keyboard, type 'hat_'. With the standard Notepad font selected (Lucida Console) the 't_' appears at a smaller size to the 'ha'.</p>
