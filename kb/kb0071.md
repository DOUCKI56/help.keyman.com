# FIX: Keyman keyboards activate but do not work

<h1>Symptoms</h1>

<p>You may experience an issue in Windows 7 where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyman Desktop is on; and</li>
<li>your Keyman keyboard is active, with its icon showing in the Keyman menu; but</li>
<li>your Keyman keyboard does not work.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Resolution</h1>

<p>To solve this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Windows Start menu.</li>
<li>In the search bar, enter: Notification Area Icons</li>
<li>Find 'Tavultesoft Keyman Engine' and select ‹Show icon and notifications›.</li>
<li>Click ‹OK›.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>When the Keyman icon is in the hidden notification area of the Windows taskbar, opening the notification area and selecting the icon causes it to change the keyboard <i>for the taskbar</i>, not for your active application. Clicking back to the active application results in the keyboard turning off again.</p>
