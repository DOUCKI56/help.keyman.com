# Switching keyboards with Visual Basic for Applications

<h1>Keyboard Switching from Visual Basic</h1><p>
Although it is not usually necessary, it is sometimes convenient to be able to
enable or disable different Keyman keyboards programmatically.  
</p><p>
A <b>Visual Basic for Applications </b>module has been written to simplify this task,
and is available from the downloads page.  The library routines used in the module 
are fully documented, and can be readily adapted for use in other programming systems.

</p><p>
You can download the VBA module from 
<a href="http://www.tavultesoft.com/keyman/downloads/">KeymanLink.zip</a>
</p>
<h2>Please Note!</h2><p>
Although this VBA module has been tested, all users use it at their own risk, 
and while we would like to be informed of any difficulties that may be encountered, 
no liability is accepted by Tavultesoft for its failure to work as described.
