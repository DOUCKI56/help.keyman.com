### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<p>If you are having difficulty uninstalling or upgrading any version of Keyman between 3.2 and 6.2, use the instructions and the special application below. This will completely remove old versions of Keyman and all associated registry entries.</p>

<p> We recommend using the uninstaller included in version 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 or later.  This tool is helpful for version 3.2, which was designed for Windows 3.1 and did not include an uninstall program. It is also helpful for later versions of Keyman, if you have had problems with Keyman failing to uninstall.</p>
