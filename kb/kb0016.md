# HOWTO: Fix 'EOleException' or 'EAccessViolation' crash when starting Keyman Developer

<p>If you receive an error similar to the following below, when starting Keyman Developer or using the Character Map within Keyman Developer, then the Unicode Character Database may have become corrupt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exception 'EOleException' in module tike.exe at 0000C0CAB
Item cannot be found in the collection corresponding to the requested name or ordinal</p>

<p>Exception 'EAccessViolation in module tike.exe at 001AB190
Access violation at address 001BC190 in module 'tike.exe'. Read of address 00000008</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Delete the file <b>unicodedata.mdb</b> in <b>c:\program files\tavultesoft\keyman developer</b> (or the folder where you installed Keyman Developer), and restart Keyman Developer. The file will be recreated.</p>

<p>The Unicode Character Database is used only within Keyman Developer Professional and during the evaluation period for Keyman Developer.</p>
