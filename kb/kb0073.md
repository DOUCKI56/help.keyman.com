# HOWTO: Fix extra apostrophes appearing when using Windows Live Mail and European Latin keyboard

<h1>Symptoms</h1>

<p>When using Windows Live Mail with the European Latin keyboard, you may find extra apostrophes appearing when trying to type words such as <b>café</b>.  This would appear as <b>caf'é</b>.  Similarly, typing a Hungarian word such as <b>osi</b> would appear as <b>"osi</b>.</p>

<p><b>Note: similar symptoms may also appear with some other keyboard layouts that use the quote keys and these instructions should resolve the problem for these other keyboard layouts in the same way.</b></p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>This issue occurs because Windows Live Mail dynamically converts "straight quotes" into “smart quotes” when you type them.  This issue is exacerbated because pressing backspace after typing the quote character restores the straight quote, rather than deleting the character you just typed.

<h1>Resolution</h1>

<p>To prevent this behaviour, you need to turn off smart quotes in Windows Live Mail. First, close Windows Live Mail (you need to close the icon in the system tray as well), then follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click Start, type <strong>regedit</strong> and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Compose\Preferences\PostEditor\Autoreplace.</strong></li>
<li>If an entry named <strong>SmartQuotes</strong> does not exist, select <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>New </strong>&gt; <strong>DWORD Value</strong>, call this new entry <strong>SmartQuotes</strong>, and press <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click on the entry <strong>SmartQuotes</strong>, and select <strong>Modify</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the value to <strong>0</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Close Registry Editor.</li>
</ol>
