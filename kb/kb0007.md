# HOWTO: Use Keyman with Windows XP Tablet PC Edition

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


Tavultesoft Keyman 6.0 can be used with applications on Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition,
but there are some limitations, due to the different (and more limited) way that Microsoft have
implemented language support on that version of Windows.  In particular, anything that depends 
on association of the Keyman keyboard with the system language, or automatically switching 
Keyman keyboards, will probably not work on the Tablet PC edition.

<h2>Workaround</h2><p>
In most cases, simply switching keyboards manually (using the Keyman hotkey or taskbar icon) will 
allow Keyman to be used.

## Applies to:
 * Keyman 6.0
 * Keyman 6.2
