# FIX: FieldWorks returns an error when detecting Keyman 

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<p>When using FieldWorks, you may encounter the error "Keyman program is not registered correctly" with a title of "Keyman initialization failed".</p>

<p>This error can arise when you have an older version of Keyman installed on your computer, but at some point installed a newer version of Keyman and subsequently uninstalled it.  Specifically, this behaviour has been seen with version 7.1 installed after uninstalling version 8.0.</p>

<p>However after uninstalling, version 8.0 left a registry setting dangling which is causing FieldWorks to look for version 8.0 instead of version 7.0.  To fix this, delete the following registry key:</p>

<blockquote>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman Engine\8.0</blockquote>

<p>This uninstall cleanup issue will be corrected in a future update of Keyman Desktop 8.0. It has been assigned an issue number I3134.</p>


## Applies to:
 * Keyman Desktop Light 7.0
 * Keyman Desktop Professional 7.0
