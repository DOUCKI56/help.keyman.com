# HOWTO: Installation of nightly packages of Keyman for Linux

Nightly alpha packages of Keyman for Linux are available on LLSO (package repo on
linux.lsdev.sil.org).

## Warning

**WARNING:** "nightly" experimental packages are untested, unsupported, and may cause problems on
your system. Do not install nightly (experimental) packages unless you understand what you are
getting into.

## Install

Launch **Terminal** and paste in the following commands. You can paste in Terminal by pressing
`CTRL-SHIFT-V`.

First paste this command to get sudo going. It may ask for your password.

```bash
sudo echo have sudo
```

Next paste these commands:

```bash
wget -qO - http://linux.lsdev.sil.org/downloads/sil-testing.gpg | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/linux-lsdev-sil-org.asc
sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://linux.lsdev.sil.org/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc)-experimental main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install keyman onboard-keyman
```

This will install the LLSO key, add the LLSO package repositories, refresh the package list, and
install Keyman for Linux as well as the _onboard-keyman_ on-screen keyboard.
