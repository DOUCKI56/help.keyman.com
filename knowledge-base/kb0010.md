# HOWTO: Resolve keyboard installation issues on Windows Server 2003

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<p>
Older versions (6.0.164.0 and earlier) of Tavultesoft Keyman fail to install keyboards by association
(i.e. by clicking on the keyboard file name) on Windows Server 2003.
</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>

<p>Upgrade to the latest release of Keyman</p>

<p>
Keyboards may still be installed by right-clicking on Keyman icon (in the taskbar's
icon tray), selecting Keyman Configuration, then using the Install keyboard button, as shown in the image
below. <br />
