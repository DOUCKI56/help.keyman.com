# Font helper can stall with Internet Explorer 6 and a very large number of fonts

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

### SYMPTOMS
On Windows XP, the font helper in Keyman Desktop can stall if a very large number of fonts is installed on the system and the system has Internet Explorer 6 installed.  When you choose a keyboard that matches many fonts, the Font Helper will collate the fonts successfully, but will then hang when trying to present the information on screen.

This issue may also arise if you have a corrupted font installed on your computer.

### DETAILS
The issue arises when the embedded Internet Explorer control used by the Font Helper attempts to load each of the fonts to present samples of each font in the Font Helper grid.

### SUGGESTED WORKAROUNDS
Reduce the number of fonts on the system, or upgrade to Internet Explorer 7 or 8.
