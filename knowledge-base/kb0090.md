### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

## Symptoms
You have a custom keyboard installed in Keyman for iPhone and iPad, and you install an updated version of the keyboard. However, after installation, the old version of the keyboard still appears.  
This is a known issue in Keyman 2.2 and 2.3. It will be addressed in a future update.

## Workaround
After installing the updated keyboard:
- Double-tap on the Home button and slide the Keyman app off the app switcher that appears, to close Keyman completely
- Once you restart Keyman, the updated keyboard should appear.
