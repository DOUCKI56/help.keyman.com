# MS Word Unicode Add-In Notes

Wordlink is an Add-In for Microsoft Word (97,2000, and 2002) to allow Unicode 
character input to MS Word with Windows 95/98/Me.  
It is not required (and should not be installed) when using Windows NT4/2000/XP.

Wordlink is included in the Keyman 6 download and installed automatically when
Keyman 6 is installed on Windows 95/98/Me.

For Keyman 5, it must be downloaded and installed separately.

## Please Note!

When using Word with Win98, if Word is not started and the user opens a document
directly by association (by clicking on the document entry or icon in an Explorer window), 
Wordlink is not able to intercept and translate the incoming characters. This is a 
limitation with the way Word processes events, and probably cannot be avoided.  

The simplest solution is to always start Word normally (thus loading and initializing
the Wordlink Add-In) before opening any documents by association.

If Unicode is to be used extensively, it is worth upgrading to Windows 2000 or 
Windows XP, since many more applications can support Unicode correctly on these 
platforms.
