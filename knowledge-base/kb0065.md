# FIX: Flashing Blue 'NONE' Interrupting Keyman

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


## Details

If typing in Keyman is being interrupted by a flashing blue box that looks like the following:

<span markdown="1" style="color: white; background: blue;">
***None***
</span>

and you are using a Lenovo computer, you should disable the program **Conexant Smart Audo** (misspelled as such) from your startup applications. This program conflicts with Keyman.

There may be an update available for Conexant Smart Audo that resolves this problem.  Contact your computer manufacturer to check for updates.

## How to Remove Conexant Smart Audo Using Autoruns

We highly recommend removing applications from Windows startup using the freely downloadable **Autoruns** program from Microsoft. 
1. Download and install the program [Autoruns](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx).
2. Open **Autoruns**.
3. Select the Everything tab.
4. Find **Conexant Smart Audo** in the list of startup programs and uncheck or delete it.


## How to Remove Conexant Using MSConfig
You may also use this method to remove **Conexant** from startup.
1. For Windows Vista or Windows 7, type 'msconfig' in the Start menu search box and press enter. For Windows XP, open **Run** from the Start menu, type 'msconfig' and click OK.
2. Select the Startup tab.
3. Find **Conexant Smart Audo** in the list of startup programs and uncheck it.
4. Click OK.
