# Windows language switcher does not always select keyboards correctly

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

## Symptoms
On some systems, the Windows 8.1 language switcher, accessible by clicking the language code near the clock, or by holding Windows key and pressing Space, does not select a keyboard layout correctly first time.  
Instead, the default language/keyboard is selected. The second time you select the keyboard, it is correctly selected.

## Workarounds
* Use Keyman's keyboard switching, via hotkey or language menu, to choose the language instead.
* Or, select the keyboard twice with the Windows language switcher.

## Applies to:
* Keyman Desktop 8.0
* Keyman Desktop 9.0
