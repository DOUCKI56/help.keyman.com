## Symptoms
You have a Keyman Update icon visible in your system notification area (don't forget to click on the expansion icon on the left to see additional icons).

## Background
In some cases, this Keyman Update icon can cause Keyman or Keyman-based apps to fail to start, as they are waiting for the update to finish.

## Workaround
Either apply or cancel the update by clicking on the icon. After this, Keyman should start normally.

## Applies to:
* Keyman Desktop 8.0
* Keyman Desktop 9.0
