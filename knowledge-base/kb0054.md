# HOWTO: Deselect the Text Services Framework Addin when using non-Unicode keyboard layouts

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

You may need to deselect the Text Services Framework Addin when working with legacy, non-Unicode, keyboard layouts on newer versions of Keyman Desktop and Microsoft Windows. If you rely heavily on such keyboards, an alternative solution is to uninstall the Keyman TSF Addin entirely (see [KMKB0052](/kb/?id=52)).

To deselect the Text Services Framework Addin for a given keyboard layout:
1. In Keyman, select your desired Keyman keyboard layout.
2. From the Windows language bar, switch your keyboard input from **Tavultesoft Keyman Desktop TSF Addin** to the Windows keyboard input option.


**Note**: If only one keyboard input option is currently available for a given language, you will be unable to switch between input options from the language bar. However, this also means that the TSF Addin is already disabled for your desired Keyman keyboard layout.
