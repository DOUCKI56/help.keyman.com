## Question #1:
How can I add my own keyboard/font to the Keyman application?

## Answer:
Please read the blog [Keyman for Android update 1.2 - Add custom keyboards to your device!](http://blog.tavultesoft.com/2014/04/keyman-for-android-update-12-add-custom-keyboards-to-your-device.html) You can also send us the keyboard and we can add it to our repository.

## Question #2:
Why do some keyboards not display all the characters correctly?

## Answer:
Some keyboards require special fonts to display correctly. Some of these fonts are either currently unavailable in the app, or there is a font rendering issue. 

For the list of keyboards with known font issues on either the iOS or Android platform, please refer to this knowledge base article here: [http://help.keyman.com/kb/83](http://help.keyman.com/kb/83)
