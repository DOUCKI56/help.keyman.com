# My antivirus or security software reports Keyman is a potential key logger, trojan or spyware

**Most importantly, Keyman is not a trojan, key logger, or spyware.**

**Keyman do not and will never engage in deceptive software practices, such as spyware, malware, viruses or trojans.**

Keyman uses advanced technology to remap your keyboard by trapping keystrokes as they are typed.  Unfortunately,
some spyware applications use the same basic method of trapping keystrokes as Keyman.  Understandably, some security
software companies have decided to warn their users when they are using a program that traps keystrokes.  This then
means that Keyman is falsely identified as spyware by some security software.

We are working with antivirus and security software companies to remedy this.  If you come across this
situation, please reach out to us at [SIL Keyman Community](https://community.software.sil.org/c/keyman/19), with details of the antivirus or security
program that is causing the problem, and we will contact the developer of that software in order to come to a resolution.

Keyman never transmits any data about what you type from your computer.  There are two modules in Keyman that include
Internet awareness:
  - **Automatic Software Updates:** Periodically, Keyman checks online at our website 
   for an updated version.  Keyman
  does not send any personally identifiable details in this process.  Keyman sends only 
   the following details to the website:
  - The application name - e.g. Keyman or Keyman Developer
    - The current version you are running

  If you would prefer not to have Keyman check for updates automatically, you can turn 
  off automatic updates in the Options tab of Keyman Configuration.

  - **Diagnostics:** Keyman Configuration includes a diagnostic tool that you can use in order to track down conflicts
  if they occur.  The diagnostic tool collects a number of details about your computer, and presents them on-screen.  You can
  then choose to send these details to Keyman team for further assistance.  The details of the report include the basic
  hardware configuration of your computer, the current configuration of Keyman, a list of currently running applications,
  a list of applications that are configured to start with Windows, and details about which languages you have installed
  in Windows.  This system information report will never be sent to us without your express approval.
  Keyman will keep this system information report confidential and will destroy it upon request.
