# HOWTO: Download a single keyboard folder from the Keyboards repository

The Keyman keyboards repository is very large, and downloading the entire
repository may be time consuming and on unstable Internet connections, difficult
to achieve.

See [Keyman Cloud Keyboard Repository](/developer/keyboards/) for details on how
to work with the Keyboards repository.

This KB article lists two possible ways to download just a single keyboard folder. First, locate the keyboard folder you wish to download from [Keyman's Keyboard Repository](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master). 

In this article, we'll be downloading the SIL IPA keyboard at [Keyman's SIL IPA Keyboard folder](https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/tree/master/release/sil/sil_ipa).

## Use an SVN client
You can use a command line SVN client to download a single folder:
```cmd
svn export https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/branches/master/release/sil/sil_ipa
```

This will export the sil_ipa keyboard into the `sil_ipa` folder. A Windows
SVN command line client is available with [sliksvn](https://sliksvn.com/download/).

## Use a web site to download a zip file
The website https://download-directory.github.io/ allows you to download a
single folder from GitHub.
- Simply paste the keyboard folder into the form.  
e.g. keyboard folder: 
https://github.com/keymanapp/keyboards/branches/master/release/sil/sil_ipa
- Press Enter.

This will download a ZIP file containing the folder which you can extract onto
your computer.
