# Microsoft Edge Browser compatibility with Keyman Desktop 9.0

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

## Compatibility Report
Microsoft Edge Browser, released as part of Windows 10, does not currently support Text Services. This means that IMEs and other text services, including Keyman Desktop 9, are unable to work with it.

## Workarounds
The only workaround at present is to use an alternate browser. Internet Explorer 11 is included with Windows 10, and other browsers such as Chrome or Firefox are freely available downloads. Keyman Desktop has been tested and works reliably with these alternative browsers.

## Applies to:
* Keyman Desktop 9.0
