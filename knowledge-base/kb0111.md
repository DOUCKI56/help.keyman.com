# Keyman for Linux: Some of my keyboards don't work properly

**Symptom:** You experience problems when typing in certain applications with
some keyboards. This affects keyboards that replace previously typed
characters, e.g. IPA (SIL) or Khmer Angkor, and affects applications that
are not compliant, i.e. don't support surrounding text. One typical
application is Chrome/Chromium.

**Solution:** There are a number of things you can verify:

- Keyman needs a **patched ibus version** to work properly with non-compliant apps.
  The patched version is available on launchpad (ppa:keymanapp/keyman). See
  [Common Questions](https://help.keyman.com/products/linux/current-version/common/).

- In general, **flatpak and snap apps** might show problems because they are
  missing an updated component. Since they bring their own versions of
  the libraries they need they are missing the updated ibus libraries. It
  is recommended to remove the snap/flatpak version and install the .deb
  version instead. A Google search will find sites that show how to install
  the .deb package instead of snap/flatpak.

- If you experience problems in **LibreOffice Writer**, make sure you installed
  the full version of LibreOffice, not just Writer. The latter is missing
  some libraries that connect Writer with gtk/ibus and thus Keyman.
  The missing packages are `libreoffice-gtk*`.
