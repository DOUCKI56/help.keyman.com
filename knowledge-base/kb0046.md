# NOTICE: OpenOffice 2.4 does not work with Alt and Ctrl key combinations

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

## SYMPTOMS

When you use a Keyman keyboard that makes use of Alt and Ctrl key combinations, these combinations have no effect in OpenOffice 2.4. Earlier versions of OpenOffice are not affected.

## WORKAROUNDS

- Use an earlier version of OpenOffice which does not have this problem.
- You could also use Keyman Developer to redesign your keyboard layout to avoid use of Alt and Ctrl key combinations.  Please contact Tavultesoft Support ([support@tavultesoft.com](mailto:support@tavultesoft.com)) for assistance with this if necessary.
- Type your text into another application and copy/paste into OpenOffice.

## MORE INFORMATION

This is due to a bug in OpenOffice 2.4. Tavultesoft are working to have this bug addressed in a future update of OpenOffice.

Please refer to [bug 91011](http://ui.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=91011) at OpenOffice for further information on the bug fix status.
