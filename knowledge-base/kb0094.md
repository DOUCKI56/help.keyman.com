# HOWTO: Disable deep text services framework integration with applications

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Keyman Desktop 9 and later versions integrates deeply with some applications to make text editing more reliable. These applications are said to support "Text Services Framework" and include programs such as Microsoft Word, SIL FLeX, and Mozilla Firefox. However, there are some situations where an application may have a bug that means that text editing becomes less reliable. These problems tend to manifest as characters being deleted unexpectedly, or keyboards not matching the correct characters, or text being inserted in the wrong place.</p>

<h1>Workaround</h1>

<dt style='font-size:.8em'><b>Warning!</b> Problems caused by improperly editing the Windows registry could render your computer operating system unusable. Microsoft provides a wealth of critical information that you need to know about the registry in the <a href='http://support.microsoft.com/support'>Microsoft Knowledge Base</a>.</dt>

<dt style='font-size:.8em'>Use the Microsoft Registry Editor only at your own risk.</dt>
</div>

<p>In this situation, you can turn off Keyman's "deep integration". This applies to all applications on the system, so you may find a loss of functionality in Keyman's interaction with other applications. To disable deep integration:</p>
