# WORKAROUND: Fonts may be missing from Character Map font dialog in Windows 7

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

On Windows 7, you may find that some non-Western script fonts are missing from the list of keyboards when you choose a font in Character Map. This is because Windows, by default, hides fonts that it thinks you don't want to use.

To change this setting:
- Go to Control Panel
- Type "Font Settings"
- Click the "Change Font Settings" link
- Untick "Hide fonts based on language settings"
- Click OK.
