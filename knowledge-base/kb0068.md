Need an easy way to remember and type a keyboard's web address for the KeymanWeb demo application? See the tips below.

## The Basics

Use the following format to link to a specific keyboard and language on the demo site:
> http://www.keymanweb.com/go/<span markdown="1" style='color:maroon;'>**languageid**</span>/<span markdown="1" style='color:navy;'>**keyboardname**</span>

The <span markdown="1" style='color:maroon;'>**languageid**</span> is the code for the language you want to select.

The <span markdown="1" style='color:navy;'>**keyboardname**</span> is the filename of the keyboard, e.g. mbsindhi or ekwtamil99uni.

These links can be found most easily in the KeymanWeb Keyboard Index page:
: http://www.keymanweb.com/en/keyboards.php.

## Linking to a Specific Demo Application

To link to a specific demo application, add the following to the URL:
> http://www.keymanweb.com/go/<span markdown="1" style='color:maroon'>**languageid**</span>/<span markdown="1" style='color:navy'>**keyboardname**</span>/<span markdown="1" style='color:darkgreen'>**application**</span>

The <span markdown="1" style='color:darkgreen'>**application**</span> can be **notepad**</span>, **twitter**</span>, **search**</span>, or **email**</span>.
