Need an easy way to remember and type a keyboard's web address for the KeymanWeb demo application? See the tips below.

## The Basics

Use the following format to link to a specific keyboard and language on the demo site:
> http://www.keymanweb.com/go/<kbd>languageid</kbd>/<kbd>keyboardname</kbd>

The **languageid** is the code for the language you want to select.

The **keyboardname** is the filename of the keyboard, e.g. mbsindhi or ekwtamil99uni.

These links can be found most easily in the KeymanWeb Keyboard Index page: http://www.keymanweb.com/en/keyboards.php.

## Linking to a Specific Demo Application

To link to a specific demo application, add the following to the URL:
> http://www.keymanweb.com/go/<kbd>languageid</kbd>/<kbd>keyboardname</kbd>/<kbd>application</kbd>

The **application** can be **notepad**, **twitter**, **search**, or **email**.
