    |    ------       |       ------             |               ----------            | 
    | Keyman 5.0   |     keyman.exe     | HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman\5.0| 
    | Keyman Developer 5.0 | tike.exe | HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman Developer\5.0| 
    | Keyman Standard Edition 6.x    | keyman.exe| HKLM\Software\Tavultesoft\Keyman\6.0 [edition] = “Standard”   |
