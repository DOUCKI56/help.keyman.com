Error Starting Program:

‘The MSIMG32.DLL file is linked to missing export GDI32.DLL.GdiGradientFill.’

Applies to: Keyman Desktop 7.0 under Windows 98SE (possibly Windows 95 and ME as well)

The above error message may appear when attempting to start Keyman Desktop under Windows 98SE. It is due to some applications updating MSIMG32.DLL with a version of the DLL distributed with Windows 2000 or later.

The correct version number of the DLL is: 5.00.1693.1.  It can be obtained from the Windows 98SE installation CD using System File Checker.

The INCORRECT version is 5.00.2180.0 -- this version is only distributed with Windows 2000 or later.

## Applies to:
* Keyman Desktop Corporate 7.0
* Keyman Desktop Light 7.0
* Keyman Desktop Professional 7.0
