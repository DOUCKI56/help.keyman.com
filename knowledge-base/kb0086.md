# Microsoft Word smart quotes interferes with deadkeys and rule matches

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant

Microsoft Word has a feature that automatically converts straight quotation marks <kbd>'</kbd> or <kbd>"</kbd> to curly quotation marks (also known as smart quotes or typographer's quotes), smart single quotation marks <kbd>‘</kbd> or smart double quotation marks <kbd>“</kbd> as you type.

However, some Keyman keyboards such as EWTS Tibetan rely on the straight quote as a deadkey or in a rule match, so when it is changed to the smart quote, the deadkey or rule match no longer runs!

You can disable this feature in Microsoft Word by following the instructions here:

To turn this feature on or off:
- 1. On the Tools menu, click AutoCorrect Options, and then click the AutoFormat As You Type tab.
- 2. Under Replace as you type, select or clear the "Straight quotes" with "smart quotes" check box.
