## Using Keyman in Excel with the **/** Key
Keyboard layouts which rely on the '**/**' key cause difficulty in Microsoft Excel. In order to provide legacy compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3, by default using the '/' key in Excel activates keyboard shortcuts. There are two solutions to this problem.

### Solution 1
Press F2 -- Whenever you type text in Excel using a layout which relies on '/', press the F2 key to enter the cell before typing.

### Solution 2
 Disable '/' shortcuts -- In the Microsoft Office Excel menu, disable the use of '/' as a shortcut key.
In Excel 2007: 
 
  - Open the Office menu button in Excel
  - Click **Excel Options**
  - Select **Advanced**
  - Scroll down to **Lotus Compatibility**
  - Delete '/' in the text box beside **Microsoft Office Excel <ins>m</ins>enu key:**
  - Click **OK**

## Keeping Context in Excel
The first key typed into any cell in Excel causes Excel to switch input into a new window. The switch of windows between the first and second key typed will cause Keyman to lose context. Any subsequent keys typed will be fine, but youâ€™ll run into difficulty if you depend on the context of the first character. To avoid this problem, you need to press F2 first before typing in any cell.
