# Greek medial Sigma changes to final Sigma unexpectedly in Microsoft Word

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


# Symptoms

When typing Greek in Microsoft Word using any Polytonic Greek-script keyboard, entering a diacritic or breathing mark on a vowel after a Sigma immediately causes the Sigma to incorrectly change to a final Sigma.  For instance, if you typed **uso/** you would get **υςό** instead of **υσό**.

# Resolution

This is due to a bug with the Microsoft Word "AutoFormat As You Type" Ordinals setting.

## Microsoft Word 2003 and older versions

- In Word, click **Tools** menu, **AutoCorrect Options...** item, and select the **AutoFormat As You Type** tab.
- Find the entry titled **Ordinals (1st) with superscript** and untick it.
- Click OK to save changes.

## Microsoft Word 2007

- In Word, click the **Office button** (top left round button), and select **Word Options** at the bottom right of the menu that appears.
- Click **Proofing** item and the **AutoCorrect Options** button.
- Select the **AutoFormat As You Type** tab.
- Find the check box titled **Ordinals (1st) with superscript** and untick it.
- Click OK to save changes.
