# INFO: About Keyman for Windows Setup

## About setup.exe

The Keyman installation bootstrapper is a self-extracting executable file that optionally contains a Windows Installer technology MSI file, and keyboard packages.

The bootstrapper uses a number of techniques to streamline installation for end users. A standard download from the keyman.com website will include just the bootstrap installer.

Setup will check for packages to install from command line parameters, the local directory it is in, and from its own filename.

### Command Line Parameters

Option | Description
-------|------------
`-c` | Continue setup after Windows restarts (this parameter is used internally)
`-s` | Install silently
`-o` | Run offline. For offline setup, all packages specified must be available as a part of the self-extracting archive or in the same folder as the setup executable.
`-x <path>` | Extract files from the self-extracting archive and exit.
`-p <package_id>[=bcp47][,...]` | Download package matching `package_id` and install associated with BCP 47 language identifier; multiple packages separated by commas.
`-t alpha|beta|stable` | Download and install the corresponding tier of Keyman for Windows from keyman.com

### keyman-setup filename patterns

The filename of the executable can be used to determine the packages to download and install from keyman.com. If the filename matches the following pattern, then the package identifiers and tier are extracted from the filename and used in the same way as the `-p` and `-t` parameters respectively.

 `keyman-setup[-tier][.package.bcp47][...].exe`

## Applies to
 * Keyman for Windows 14.0

## History
 * Keyman for Windows 14.0 adds the `-p` and `-t` parameters and also parses the installer filename; earlier versions required all content to be included in the self-extracting archive.
