# HOWTO: Resolve keyboard conflicts with other applications

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


<p>
In some situations, Keyman can fail to map a keyboard as expected.
The most frequent reason for this is that some other application is also trapping keyboard input, and not passing input messages on to Keyman in an approved manner.  Applications such as <b>BibleWorks</b>, <b>SameTime</b>, and some development tools within Oracle have been found exhibit this behaviour. 
</p>
<h2>Workarounds</h2><p>
Keyman 6.2 includes a diagnostic tool to locate conflicts and conflict detection code.  The conflict detection code will automatically avoid conflicts in 99% of cases, thus it is recommended to upgrade to version 6.2 if you are experiencing this issue with an older version.
</p><p>
If a conflicting application that is not actually being used can be identified, terminate that application before using Keyman.  Otherwise, if any application (such as <b>BibleWorks</b>) that 
is being used with Keyman is found to prevent Keyman working correctly, starting Keyman <i>after</i> the conflicting application will usually allow Keyman to be used normally.
