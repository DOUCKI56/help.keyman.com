# FIX: Keyman keyboards activate but do not work

### **NOTE**: This archived documentation has not been updated recently and may contain information that is no longer relevant


## Symptoms

You may experience an issue in Windows 7 where:
- Keyman Desktop is on; and
- your Keyman keyboard is active, with its icon showing in the Keyman menu; but
- your Keyman keyboard does not work.

## Resolution

To solve this problem:

- Open the Windows Start menu.
- In the search bar, enter: Notification Area Icons
- Find 'Tavultesoft Keyman Engine' and select ‹Show icon and notifications›.
- Click <kbd>OK</kbd>.

## Background

When the Keyman icon is in the hidden notification area of the Windows taskbar, opening the notification area and selecting the icon causes it to change the keyboard *for the taskbar*, not for your active application. Clicking back to the active application results in the keyboard turning off again.
