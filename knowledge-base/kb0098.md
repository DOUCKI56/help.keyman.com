# kmshell.exe Command Line Parameters

On Windows, Keyman Configuration can be run with command line arguments to automate a number of tasks. It is also possible to use the Keyman for Windows API to accomplish all these tasks, but some are more easily accessed via the command line.

The command line program is called `kmshell.exe`, and if run with no arguments `kmshell.exe` will start Keyman.

The following command line arguments are available:

Argument | Description
---------|-------------
`-c` | Start Keyman Configuration user interface
`-i filename[=bcp47]` | Install a keyboard (.kmx) or package (.kmp) file, optionally associating with a specific language
`-uk filename.kmx` | Uninstall a keyboard (.kmx file)
`-up filename.kmp` | Uninstall a package (.kmp file)
`-h` | Open Keyman help contents
`-t` | Start Keyman text editor
`-ouc` | Check for updates online and prompt user if updates are found
`-kw package` | Show help for the installed keyboard package
`-kp keyboard` | Start print wizard for on screen keyboard for the keyboard
`-s` | Where relevant, run silently, without user interface prompts


If `kmshell.exe` is run as an elevated command, then the command will run in local machine context, otherwise it will affect only the current user. `-i`, `-uk`, `-up` all require elevation to succeed.
