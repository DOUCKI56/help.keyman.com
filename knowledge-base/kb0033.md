You can use the Keyman COM API in Keyman Desktop 7.0 to control Tavultesoft Keyman from most macro languages.  An example is presented for Microsoft Word's Visual Basic for Applications.

To create these macros, you will need to do the following:

- In Word, select Tools &rarr; Macro &rarr; Visual Basic Editor (2000, XP, 2003) or press Alt+F11. (In Word 2007, press Alt+F11)
- In the Project pane, double-click Normal &rarr; Microsoft Word Objects &rarr; ThisDocument
- Select Tools &rarr; References.
- Scroll down to Tavultesoft Keyman Library, tick it and click OK
- Paste the functions in and change the fonts and keyboard names as desired.  You can add additional functions for the extra keyboards you want to activate

You could assign hotkeys or toolbar buttons to these routines.  See the following links for more details:

- [Assign a macro to a toolbar](http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Customization/AsgnCmdOrMacroToToolbar.htm)
- [Assign a macro to a hotkey](http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Customization/AsgnCmdOrMacroToHotkey.htm)
- [Assign a macro to the Ribbon in Word 2007](http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Customization/CustomizeRibbon.htm)

The macros are presented below:

```visual-basic
      ' Keyman COM API access in Visual Basic for Applications
      ' ------------------------------------------------------
      '
      Sub SwitchEuropeanLatinOn()
         Selection.Font.Name = "Gentium"
         Dim t As TavultesoftKeyman
         Set t = New TavultesoftKeyman
         t.Control.ActiveKeyboard = t.Keyboards("european")
            ' Use the filename of the keyboard here (without the '.kmx' extension)
            ' You can findout the filename of the keyboard by viewing its details
            ' in Keyman Desktop Configuration
      End Sub

      Sub SwitchKeymanOff()
         Selection.Font.Name = "Arial"
         Dim t As TavultesoftKeyman
         Set t = New TavultesoftKeyman
         t.Control.ActiveKeyboard = Nothing
      End Sub
```

You can create a macro that toggles the Keyman keyboard and font as follows:

```visual-basic
     Sub ToggleKeyboard_Greek()
         Dim t As TavultesoftKeyman, k As IKeymanKeyboard
         Set t = New TavultesoftKeyman
         Set k = t.Control.ActiveKeyboard
               
         If k Is Nothing Then
            v = 1
         ElseIf k.Name < "GalaxieGreekKM6" Then 'Change this to your desired keyboard name
            v = 1
         Else
            v = 0
         End If
         
         If v = 1 Then
               Selection.Font.Name = "Galaxie Unicode Greek" 'Change this to your desired font name
               t.Control.ActiveKeyboard = t.Keyboards("GalaxieGreekKM6") 'Change this to your desired keyboard name
         Else
               Selection.Font.Name = "Times New Roman" 'Change this to your desired default font name
               t.Control.ActiveKeyboard = Nothing
         End If
      End Sub
```
