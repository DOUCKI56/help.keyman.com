# Using Adobe Acrobat Reader with Keyman Desktop

<h1>Symptoms</h1>
<p>When Adobe Acrobat Reader is open, you experience that you cannot type using a Keyman keyboard in the search box, the comment section nor the Fill & Sign .</p>

<h1>Issue</h1>
<p>The problem is that Adobe Acrobat Reader by default blocks all external applications from interaction, due to many longstanding security issues with it.</p>

<h1>Resolution</h1>

<p>Keyman Desktop 12 does not resolve the issue with Keyman keyboards not typing in Adobe Acrobat Reader. For a simple workaround, you can turn off Protected Mode in Adobe Acrobat Reader. Here's how:</p>

<ol>
<li>In Adobe Acrobat Reader, open <b>Edit / Preferences</b></li>
<li>Under <b>Security (Enhanced)</b>, deselect <b>Enable Protected Mode at startup</b></li>
<li>Click OK.</li>
<li>Restart Adobe Acrobat Reader</li>
</ol>

<p>This workaround enables you to type using Keyman keyboard in Adobe Acrobat Reader in the search box and the comment section, but not in the Fill & Sign.</p>
