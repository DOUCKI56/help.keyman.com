<li>uninstkmp.zip - Uninstall Keyman Desktop Pro.</li>
<li>uninstkml.zip - Uninstall Keyman Desktop Light.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code in this batch file is:</p>

<blockquote><code>
@echo off<br />
rem ** Change C:\Program Files to the actual path of your Program Files folder **<br />
set PROGRAMFILES=c:\Program Files<br />
%windir%\system\msiexec /x {9FFA5AC0-21BC-4495-8FE0-F6B86954F507}<br />
</code></blockquote>
